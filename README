== WHAT IS THIS? ==
This is a test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver/TestNG/Ant/Maven and page-object approach (PageFactory).

== HOW TO USE IT? ==
Example site included, just unpack localsite_files.tar.gz archive to the selng/ subdirectory of your local web server's root directory.
Initial framework contains examples of tests.

You can run Ant targets either directly or via Maven Antrun plugin (Maven is not needed if using targets directly).

Ant targets:
	ant clean - remove old classes and directories
	ant build - compile changed classes
	ant run_test -Dfeature="LocalTest" -Dtest="verifyNinethPage" - run a specific test
	ant run_chrome_tests -Dgroups="regression,smoke" -Dexcludedgroups="inprogress" - run all tests from the selected groups under Chrome browser, excluding certain groups
	ant run_firefox_tests -Dgroups="regression,smoke" -Dexcludedgroups="inprogress" - run all tests from the selected groups under Firefox browser, excluding certain groups

This way you can run the above targets using Maven Antrun plugin:
	mvn -P ant-target -D target=clean
	mvn -P ant-target -D target=build
	mvn -P ant-target -D target=run_firefox_tests -Dgroups="regression,smoke" -Dexcludedgroups="inprogress"

== REQUIREMENTS ==
	Java >= 1.6
	Apache Ant
	Maven
	Web browser (FF, Chrome, IE).
	Chromedriver is required for Chrome, you can find it here: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver
	OS: Linux, Windows or Mac OS X.

Enjoy!
